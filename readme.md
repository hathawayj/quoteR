## quoteR R package

This is just a place holder for a quote management package that I would like to build.  Here are the objectives

1. Handle `.bib` files and be able to move to `tibbles`.  Probably will use functions from the `bib2df` package.
2. Look at using [FavQs](https://favqs.com/) web [API](https://favqs.com/api)
3. Store quotes and reviews in markdown files that can be referenced.
5. Provide a function that builds the markdown quote with link to reference as an inline or main quote.
6. Provide a way for a user to use quotes from tibble (or goodreads) in their writing in an `.md` or most likely a`.qmd`.
7. A function that searches through a blog's files to build a summary of how often quotes have been used or books have been cited.

## favQs Website

The [FavQs](https://favqs.com/) website has [an API](https://favqs.com/api).  It looks like it will let me push and pull quotes. Private quote management is only $5.99 a year and they use stripe to manage payments.
